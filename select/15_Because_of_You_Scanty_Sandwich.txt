You don't stop
You don't stop
I remember when I saw you, baby
You're looking real cool and sexy
You got me wondering if you saw me maybe
Oh yeah, babe
Everything you're doing's got me
Changing my mood
I got a new attitude
That's saying something for me
'Cause I was that girl
Standing alone
Watching every move you make
Wishing you would take me home
Because of you I've no sense of time
I'm losing my mind, I've left the little girl behind
Because of you the woman in me is setting me free, yeah
Living out my fantasy because of you
Do you thing there was
A chance that we could get together?
The kind of loving that could last forever
Come rain or shine, no matter what the weather
Oh yeah, babe
Wondering it's time
I should be making my move
I really wanna get you into my grove
Come and see me I got something to prove
'Cause I was that girl
Quiet and shy
Scared to say a word to you
Hoping I would catch your eye
Because of you I've no sense of time
I'm losing my mind, I've left the little girl behind
Because of you the woman in me is setting me free
Living out my fantasy because of you
'Cause I was that girl
Standing alone
Watching every move you make
Wishing you would take me home
Because of you
I've made my move
Because of you
I'm feeling free
Because of you I've no sense of time
I'm losing my mind, I've left the little girl behind
Because of you the woman in me is setting you free
Living out my fantasy
Because of you I've no sense of time
I'm losing my mind, I've left the little girl behind
Because of you the woman in me is setting me free
Living out my fantasy because of you
