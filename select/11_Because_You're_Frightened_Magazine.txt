You love me because you're frightened
And I'm falling in love with you
Because I'm getting frightened
Of the things you somehow make me do
You love me because you're frightened
I can easily believe my eyes
Your fear is my finest hour
My fear is your disguise

Look what fear's done to my body

A frightening world
Is an interesting world to be in
In the Forbidden City
Or on The Roof of the World
Or at the receiving end
Of the nine o'clock news
However you put your mind to it
You can find fear where you choose

Look what fear's done to my body

You want to hurt
You want to crave
You want to praise and curse and blame
You want to believe just what you like
Then you want to hurt and crave again

They took you to the top of the mountain
They showed you the valley
You bought it
You couldn't wait, could you!

Look what fear's done to my body

You want to hurt ...
